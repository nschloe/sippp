/****h* BenchIT/Robofile
* DESCRIPTION
* Contrary to doxygen, robodoc doesn't analyze the underlying structure
* of the source code. The advantage of this is that robodoc can be used
* with any type of source as long as this programming language supports
* any of the numberous markers robodoc recognizes. the disadvantage is
* that you have to rebuild the code-structure yourself - which is done
* with doxygen automatically.

/****h* BenchIT/LOCALDEFS
* DESCRIPTION
* Every machine has its own set of Definitions which have to be
* generated when BenchIT is used for the first time.
* There are 3 files for each machine. Each of these 3 files start
* with the name of the machine which we get from the 
* uname_minus_a script (to be found in the tools-directory).

* DESCRIPTION
* BenchIT is capable of performing a wide range of different
