This folder contains tools to find good parameters for the random number 
generator included in  the benchit.c. Our random number generator actually uses 
2 random numbergenerators and returns the bitwise XOR of them. Both generators 
use the simple formula r(n+1) = ((a * r(n)) + b) mod m. As we use 2 generators 
we need a1,a2,m1,m2,b1,b2 to be specified in the bi_random_init(...) function 
within benchit.c. Additionally we need fix1 and fix2. Those 2 values specify 
the fixpoints of the 2 generators (fix= ((a * fix) + b) mod m).

There are some restrictions to the parameters:

1) m1 and m2 have to be prime numbers > 2,815e+14 (more than 48 Bit)
2) m1 and m2 are not the same number
3) a1 is a primitive root of m1, a2 is a primitive root of m2
4) a1 and a2 should not be a very small number (2,3,5,7,11,13)
5) a1*m1 and a2*m2 are smaller than 2^64 (to avoid overflows)
6) b1 is smaller than m1, b2 is smaller than m2
7) fix1 = ((a1*fix1) + b1) mod m1, fix2 = ((a2*fix2) + b2) mod m2
8) all parameters are positive numbers

We already have a set of parameters defined in the benchit.c that meets all 
restrictions. The values should not be changed in order to get comparable 
results. However, if you want to change them anyway here's how to find suitable 
parameters:

1) run make within this directory or execute the compile.sh to build the tools.
2) use ./prime to find prime numbers for m
3) use ./prim_root to find possible values for a
   it could take a while to find an m that has a primitive root that is not too 
   small so you should make sure to generate enough prime numbers in step 2 
   (max should be greater than min+1000)
4) make sure a * m does not overflow a 64-Bit unsigned integer otherwise repeat 
   step 2 and/or 3
5) choose b with the only restriction that it is smaller than m
6) use ./fixpoint to find the fixpoint for your parameters

Once you have found suitable parameters enter them in the bi_random_init(...) 
function. At the end of the bi_random_init function the fixpoints are replaced 
by other values. Make sure that those values really differ from the fixpoints.
