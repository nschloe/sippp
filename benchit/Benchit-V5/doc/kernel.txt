1. What's a kernel?

A kernel is a piece of code representing one special measuring objective. This can be a sorting/search algorithm, a numerical operation like matrixmultiplication or a memory-operation like pointerchasing or even a n application of which you like to measure the cpu-load or a certain computingtime.

2. What does a kernel consist of?

At least a sourcecodefile containing your measuring objective and a bunch of functions which are needed by the benchit-interface to conduct the measuremant. You also need a PARAMTERS-file which lists all the environment-variables which must be set accordingly by the user to create a measurement.
