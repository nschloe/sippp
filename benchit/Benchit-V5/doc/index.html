      Documentation for BenchIT

  <body>
    This is an attempt of writing a documentation for BenchIT.<br><br>
    
    Due to the fact that BenchIT was written by many loosely coupled<br>
    and more or less independent groups of people, this documentation<br>
    also apears loosely connected at one point or the other. One<br>
    little excuse for that may be the fact that this documentation was<br>
    written with at least two totally different documentationtools,<br> 
    namely doxygen and robodoc.<br>
    The structur of the docu is more or less similar to the structur<br>
    of the BenchIT-source-directory for (hopefully) easier navigation.<br>

    If you are a fan of index-pages than you might be happier with one<br>
    of the following:<br>    
    <a href="./doc/robodoc/robo_sourcefiles.html">sourcecodefiles</a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a structured / hierarchical tree of all 
    documented files in the <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BenchIT-source-directory<br>
    <a href="./doc/robodoc/masterindex.html">MasterIndex</a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a list of all pages available<br>
    <a href="./doc/robodoc/robo_classes.html">classes</a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a list of all classes<br>
    <a href="./doc/robodoc/robo_functions.html">functions</a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a list of all functions<br>
    <a href="./doc/robodoc/robo_modules.html">modules</a><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a list of modules / directories<br>
