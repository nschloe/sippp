1. Introduction
---------------

The benchit shell script eases running multiple kernels from your shell.
It is not intended to be a replacement for the Java GUI. Therefore it has no
ability to execute kernels on a remote computer and the handling is by far not
as convenient as the GUI.

The remainder of this document will describe the functionality of the benchit
shell script.


2. The benchit shell script
---------------------------

The following sections describe the function of the particular menu entries.
Which menu entries are available depends on your progress and your environment.
If there e.g. is no GUI available, the "Start GUI" menu item will not show up,
and the latter menu items depend on former ones, so not all will be shown at
once.

2.1 "Start GUI"
---------------
Start the BenchIT GUI. You need to have a window system and Java installed in
order to use it.
Documentation for the GUI is located under doc/

2.2 "Select your set of kernels"
--------------------------------
A file with a list of available kernels will be created.
Here you choose which kernels you want to work with in the next steps.
If you want to add kernels later on, you have to insert them manually, or you
can cleanup (last but one menu entry), then the list will be regenerated, but
you will lose all your custom parameter settings.

2.3 "Set parameters for your kernelset"
---------------------------------------
The parameters from your selected kernels will be copied to one file which you
can edit afterwards and adjust the configuration for each kernel.

2.4 "Compile your kernelset"
----------------------------
This starts the compilation of the selected kernels with the parameters you have
set in the previous step.

2.5 "Run your kernelset"
------------------------
After the kernels have been compiled, you can start them using this menu entry.
Take a cup of tea or coffee if you have selected a large amount of kernels and
have not set a timelimit.

2.6 "View the most recent resultfile of each selected kernel"
-------------------------------------------------------------
This will open the output file from the last measurement of each kernel in the
list you have selected at 2.2, provided that you have gnuplot and gv or gview
installed as these will be used to generate and show the images.
Beware that you might get numerous windows if you have selected many kernels.
If there are no output files for your selection available at all, this menu
entry will not be available.

2.7 "Cleanup all generated files"
---------------------------------
This erases the selection of kernels and your custom parameters.

2.8 "Exit"
----------
Quit the CLI.
