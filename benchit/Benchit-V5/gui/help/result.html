<p>
After pressing <i>Show Results</i> a window opens with a list of all result files found in your BenchIt directory.<BR>
If you can not see anything, you may have not run any BenchIt test jet, or your BenchIt path isn't set correctly 
[<a href="admin.html">see admin</a>].<BR>
You can choose one or more results by using the Ctrl- or Shift-key. Then press <i>Show Selected</i>, if you have
the jfreechart and jcommon libraries the results are shown in a fine java created diagram [<a href="#java">more</a>],
if not, gnuplot ang gv are used.

You have two possibilities to look at the results: graphical and text only. You can switch between both
views by clicking on the tabs <i>plot</i> and <i>text</i>. There is a third tab (<i>config</i>) for configurations.
</p>
<p>
<u>the result as text</u><br>
This is a direct look at the result file created by BenchIt. There is a lot of information displayed, which is
not completely shown in the graphical view.
</p>
<p>
<u>the result as graphical plot</u><br>
Here you see the result plotted as a fine diagram.<br>
You can zoom in by dragging a frame from top left to bottom right, to zoom out drag a frame from bottom right to
top left. Also you can zoom by using the PopupMenu that is opening on right click over the diagram.<br>
You have also the possibility to print or save the diagram or to change some properties by using the PopupMenu.<br>
<i>Properties...</i> allows you to change some properties which belong to the plot.<br>
<i>Save as...</i> allows you to save the diagram to disk as a png.<br>
<i>Print...</i> allows you to print the diagram.
</p>
<p>
<u>the config tab</u><br>
Here is a button for disabling or reenabling the two blue lines following the pointer (called crosshair).<br>
You may also specify custom ranges for the achses of the plotwindow. By pressing the button <i>set</i> the values are saved and the plot is
repainted. The button <i>reset</i> restores the default values.
