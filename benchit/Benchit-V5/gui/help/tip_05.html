<h1>Did you know...</h1>

<br>
It's strongly recommended that you exit
<strong>all</strong> other programs that are running
<strong>before</strong> you start any kernel to
measure out your system. Any running program may
interrupt the measurement routines at any time
resulting in <strong>poorer performance</strong>
figures for your system.
