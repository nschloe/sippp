<h2><a name="what">What is it?</a></h2>
<p>The graphical user interface of the BenchIt program provides you to set 
values of different parameters, which are defined in the program. So it is 
possible to change them without manual editing the local def files.</p>
<p><a href="#BIG">top</a></p>

<h2><a name="howto">How to start?</a></h2>
<p>At first you have to set some properties to adjust the program.<br>
You can do this by two ways:</p>
<p><u>start program with several arguments</u> [<a href="args.html">more</a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li>-host=[hostname] ... host to load</li>
  <li>-config=[filename] ... config XML-file to load</li>
  <li>-admin ... loads the AdminTool</li>
  <li>-debug[class]=[level] ... init. the debug level</li>
</ul>
<p><u>set properties after starting the program</u></p>
<p><a href="#BIG">top</a></p>

<h2><a name="params">Parameters</a></h2>
<p>Each parameter has its own type, value, default value and any other
attributes, which can be edit by the AdminTool and set by the user. Every file
loaded by the config file contains several parameters, which can be adjusted by
the user. The easiest way to set them is to fill the text fields and similar
compontents with a value in the &quot;clickIt&quot; environment. But it is also possible
to edit the local definition files manually in the &quot;editIt&quot;- tab.</p>
<p><a href="#BIG">top</a></p>

<h2><a name="cfgFile">Config File</a></h2>
<p> We have also implemented a Config File named BGUI.cfg. Here you can insert some settings for the GUI.
 Mostly these are commented, so if you want to know, what they do look in the file
 <a href="../BGUI.cfg">BGUI.cfg</a>
</p>
<p><a href="#BIG">top</a></p>

<h2><a name="view">View Level</a></h2>
<p>Adjusting the view level makes it possible to show or hide parameters, 
which are not so often changed. So you have a better overview about 
essential parameters.</p>
<p><a href="#BIG">top</a></p>

<h2><a name="save">Save</a></h2>
<p>You have to save your modifications before you can execute BenchIt. In this 
case the files from the tabbed pane were created or overriden with the current 
parameter settings. Please notice that only parameters were written in the file, 
which value differs from the default value.</p>
<p><a href="#BIG">top</a></p>

<h2><a name="execute">Execute BenchIt</a></h2>
<p>After you set all parameters you have to save your modifications. A new frame 
is opened, where you can select which BenchIt kernels should be executed by the 
program. During the execution the graphical program is shut down. So the results are less 
falsified. For the most exact results you should exit all running applications (daemons, X, ...) and if possible, enter 
single user mode (on linux systems: init s) and execute the kernels manually (SUBDIREXEC.SH)</p>
<p><a href="#BIG">top</a></p>

<h2><a name="result">Show Results</a></h2>
<p>This button enables you to show the result files, created by BenchIt, in a 
fine diagram. You can select more than one, to compare the selected to each other. If you have the jfreechart and jcommon libraries
the display is done in java. if not, then the files are displayed using gnuplot and gv. <br>
In the java plot window you can zoom in and out using the context menu or by dragging an rectangle from topleft to bottomright
of the area to zoom to. To zoom out you drag the rectangle from bottomright to topleft. There is also an option to print the plot or to
save it as png (context menu).

<h2><a name="console">Console</a></h2>
<p>The console provides you to trace the way of the program. If debug is on, a 
lot of debuging messages will be displayed in it. If an error occurs it is also 
displayed in the console in bold red text. The button export makes it 
possible to export the content of the console to a file in the log 
directory. With the clear button you remove every content from the console 
window.</p>
