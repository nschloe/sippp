	<h2>What is BenchIT?</h2>
	BenchIT is a program to support your scientific performance measurements. It provides a clear interface and let you collate your system to others.
	More information under <a href="www.benchit.org">www.benchit.org</a>.
	<h2>BenchIT - structure</h2>
	<h3>Structure of a kernel</h3>
	Every kernel must be in the kernel directory of BenchIT and needs 2 Scripts: COMPILE.SH and RUN.SH. Also it needs the sourcefiles in the same directory.
	<h3>Selecting a kernel</h3>
		BenchIT supports the selecting of different kernels and their starting by the b-care-shell and the GUI.<br>

		Also you can select whether you want to compile the kernel, run it or do both.

	<h3>Starting a kernel</h3>
	After you've selected the kernels, you want to start, a script is generated, which calls all the selected scripts.
	Those call different scripts provided by BenchIT.
