	<h2>Click and find</h2>
	<!-- some pictures to roll over -->
	<h2>Basics</h2>
	<h3>Security in Connection</h3>
		The connection is encrypted by using SSL, this encrypts the datastreams between your clientsoftware and our server also it has several other features (look for literature about networking and security or visit wikipedia).

	<h3>Add the server generated key to the trusted base</h3>
		Before you can connect to the database, you need an account at www.benchit.org and you must have started a script within the gui-bin-Directory:<br>
		Under Unix:<font face="Courier New">./AddKeyToKeyStore.SH</font><br>
		Under Windows:<font face="Courier New">AddKeyToKeyStore.bat</font><br>
		While running you will be asked for a password. We would like you to choose the Password "BenchIT". If you choose another one, you must edit the run-script in the same way.<br>
		Also you will be asked whether you would like to add the Certificate from our server. Type "Yes" in the given (the installed sdks) language. (e.g. in France: Oui, In Germany: Ja ...)<br>
		After this a file was generated within the Config-Directory of the GUI. It's name is client.trusts. So if you can't connect to the database, check for this file first.
	<h2>Connection</h2>
	<h3>Start Connection</h3>
		When you are switching to the Database Connection Mode and are not connected yet, you will be asked for a username and a paasword.
		Those are the same as the ones you have at www.benchit.org.
		<font color=#aa0000>Problems:</font>If you can't connect to our server a message will appear under the password field. If not, please send an email with the console's content to a developer of the GUI.
