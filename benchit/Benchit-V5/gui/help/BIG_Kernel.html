	<h2>Basics</h2>
	<a name="What are kernels"></a>
	<h3>What are kernels</h3>
	We define a kernel as performance measuring programs, which use the BenchIT interface.
	Those can be mathematical kernels like Matrix Multiplication, Vector Addition or a
	Sinus/Cosinus-measuring program. But also they can measure IO-Speed, RAM-Access and so on.
	<a name="Sourcecodefiles"></a>
	<h3>Sourcecodefiles</h3>
	The Editor will have tabs, containing the files of the kernel.<font color="#aa0000">Problems:</font>All Files within the directory will be displayed! Even 100MB JPGs!!!
	Those files should be: COMPILE.SH - this file is used to compile the kernel, PARAMETERS - this file will contain settings for the kernel, and source-code files.
	If you don't want to edit the source-code, but save memory, you can disable the flag kernelsourceedit in Setup &rarr; Preferrences.
	<a name="How_to_generate_kernels"></a>
	<h3>How to generate kernels</h3>
	We generated a HOWTO for this, which can be found at <a href="www.benchit.org"> www.benchit.org </a>.
	You may also select &quot;Duplicate&quot; from a kernels popup-menu to duplicate this kernel and make changes.<font color="#aa0000">Problems:</font>The new files will have no eXecutable-flag!
	You may also add /remove single files to/from a kernel.
	<a name="Used_packages"></a>
	<h3>Used packages</h3>
	Here we use a syntax-highlighting by jedit.org, which is under MIT style license.<br>

	<h2>The BenchIT GUI's Kernelmode</h2>
	<a name="Switching_to_the_Kernelmode"></a>
	<h3>Switching to the Kernelmode</h3>
	By clicking on the "Kernel" tab or into the kernel tree area the kernelmode is activated.
	<a name="The_Kerneltree"></a>
	<h3>The Kerneltree</h3>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<img src="KernelTree.png" width="150" height="319" border="0">
			</td>
			<td>
				On the left side of the screen, you should see a tree, which has initially the
				same structure like the kernel directory of BenchIT.
				This is the Kerneltree, where you can select the kernels you want to start or edit.
				Select a single Kernel by clicking a leaf, select several by clicking nodes or
				hold CTRL down while selecting nodes and leaves.
				The last selected node or leaf will be shown on the left side. While the files
				are loaded, you can watch the progress at the lower left corner.

	<a name="What_to_do"></a>
	<h3>What to do</h3>
	In the upper right corner of the GUI is a combobox, where you can select what you
	want to do with the kernel.<br>
	The Options are:<br>
	<ul>
  	<li> Compile and Run </li>
  	<li> Compile only </li>
  	<li> Run only </li>
	</ul>
	In the following, we suppose, you've selected "Compile and Run". If you have
	selected another one, mostly the procedures to start something are the same.
	<br><a href="#start">to begin</a>
	<a name="The_Edit_-_Area"></a>
	<h3>The Edit - Area</h3>
	<b>The Editor</b><br>
	Within the editor you can see the source of the file whose name is shown as tab.
	FORTRAN will be shown right normal, Shellscript-Files, JAVA, C and Headerfiles
	with syntax-highlighting. (See Kernelfiles - Sourcecodefiles)<br>
	<br><a href="#start">to begin</a><br>
	<a name="Having_selected_a_node"></a>
	<h3>Having selected a node</h3>
	If you have selected a node, an additional combobox will appear above the sources, under the toolbar, right of the "Save Changes" Button.
	Here you can select the kernel, whose files you want to edit.
	<h3>Kernelfiles - RUN.SH</h3>
	see BenchIT - Structure - Run-Script.
	<h3>Kernelfiles - COMPILE.SH</h3>
	see BenchIT - Structure - Compile-Script.
	<h3>Kernelfiles - PARAMETERS</h3>
	see BenchIT - Structure - PARAMETERS-Script.

	<a name="Starting_a_kernel"></a>
	<h2>Starting a kernel</h2>
	<a name="Starting_a_kernel_locale"></a>
	<h3>Starting a kernel locale</h3>
	The ordinary way to start a kernel is to start it from the computer BenchIT
	is running on. Select the Kernels, you want to start (see The Kerneltree) and
	start it by using one of these Options:
	<ul>
		<LI>Use the Kernel-menu</LI>
		<LI>Use the short-cut <b>CTRL-E</b></LI>
		<LI>Use the <a href="#The_Kerneltree">Kerneltree</a>'s popupmenu.</LI>
	</ul>
	<br>
	You will be asked whether to shut down the GUI or not. Not shutting the GUI down will
	have influence on the measuring.
	<br><a href="#start">to begin</a>
	<a name="Remote-Folder-Execution"></a>
	<h2>Remote-Folder-Execution</h2>
	This one, like the locale execution, only works for UNIX!
	<a name="Creating_a_Remote-Folder"></a>
	<h3>Creating a Remote-Folder</h3>
	For starting a kernel on an other system remote, you first got to define a Remote-Folder.
	Do this by selecting the Menu-entry "Setup-Create Remote Folder"<br>
	In the following Frame, select your Options:
	<ul>
		<li>IP or DNS-name: Here you shall write the IP or the DNS-name of the computer,
		you want to start the kernel.</li>
		<li>Username: The username on the remote computer</li>
		<li>temporary directory: This will be a directory within the GUI's temporary path,
		but also a folder within the remote computers home directory.<br>
		<font color="#aa0000">Problems:</font> The selected path can overwrite data on
		the remote computer!
		</li>
		<li>Use SCP. Use this option only, if other copy fails (because tar isn't supported in the typical POSIX-compliant form.)
		This is not available under Windows<br>
		<font color="#aa0000">Problems:</font> It may be, that additional output is produced by both: ssh and tar.
		This may harm the transferred data. So please be sure, that this doesn't happen.
		</li>
	</ul>
	Afterwards you got to type your password at the console, the BenchIT GUI was started from.<br>
	<font color="#aa0000">Problems:</font> If you don't want to start BenchIT GUI from a console, please be sure that
	you can start ssh-connections to an other computer without typing a passwort or have a SSH-X-Password-reader.
	<a name="Executing_in_Remote-Folder"></a>
	<h3>Executing in Remote-Folder</h3>
	Basicly, this can be selected in the same way as a local execution. Clicking the right mouse-button on the kernel-tree 
	or selecting the entry in the Measure-Menu.
	Be sure that there are valid LOCALDEFS for the selected machines on your system or in the LOCALDEF-folders on the
	remote machines.
	You will be asked at which Remote-Folders the selected kernels shall be executed and whether to check LOCALDEFS or not.
	<font color="#aa0000">Problems:</font> It may be that the internal hostname of a
	system differs from the external one. Switch this option off and check manually,
	whether the LOCALDEFS exist.
	Then there are 2 password-checks for every system you selected: one for copying, one for executing.
	<font color="#aa0000">Problems:</font> Please be aware, that all files (even existing Result-Files)
	 within the Remote-Folder will have the execute-bit set.
